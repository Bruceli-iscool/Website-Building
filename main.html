            1. The console.log() Function:
            You can use console.log() to print something in the terminal.
            For example, "console.log(4)" prints 4. Also, using single quotes(''), you can print strings! Without ' marks, you can only print integers and/or varibles.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Easy Varibles:
            You can assign a varible that it's value can't change by using "var x = 5", to break it down, x is the varible name and 5 is the value.
            If you want a varible that's value can change, use "let y = 2", to break it down, y is the varible name and 2 is the value. To assign a string to a varible, use "var f = 'John', in the code, ' mark does the same thing it does in the console.log('') from lesson one.
